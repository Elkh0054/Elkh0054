    As a result of the Covid19 situation, I wanted to give my kids and neighbors  
   glimpse of happiness. As a family we prepared small gifts with a handmade cards with motivational
   words signed by anonymous and dropped them by our neighbors'doors. The best part was to run and hide 
   before they see us :)

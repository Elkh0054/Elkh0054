    <p> As a result of the Covid19 situation, I wanted to offer my kids and neighbors  
   glimpse of happiness. As a family we prepared small gifts with a handmade cards with motivational
   words signed by anonymous and dropped them by our neighbors'doors.  best part was to <strong> "run and hide 
   before getting caught by them:)" </strong> </p>
